### Background
This is a simple CLI utility to retrieve a secret from AWS Parameter Store.  Sometimes you simply need to retrieve a secret.  Additionally, you might have to assume another role in order to do this, maybe because a secret resides in another account.  In either case, this lightweight utility is designed to address this need with cross-platform compatibility.
